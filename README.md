# vue-active-item

Simple renderless component for toggle behavior

Demo and examples [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/7zmlmwjjk1)

## Concept

> One component to rule them all

ActiveItem is a renderless component which manage toggle state. If you need to know ***if* an element is active** or ***which* element is active** so ActiveItem is made for you ! You will be able to develop **your** component, with **your** styles, **your** animations, which will perfectly suit **your** needs !

It can be very interesting in projects not fully managed in js, to be able to toggle simple elements like dropdowns, modal, tabs, header...

Only one prerequisite: know the [Vue slot-scope](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Scoped-Slots).

See the [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/7zmlmwjjk1) to see examples in action.
